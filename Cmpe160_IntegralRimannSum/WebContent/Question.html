					Question:
					<code>Integral of a Polynomial (100 points)</code>

					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>
					In this project you are going to calculate the definite integral of a polynomial using <b>Riemann Sums</b>

					<p>Riemann sum is a numerical method to approximate the integral of a continuous function f(x). The method applies the following steps:</p>

					<li>Divide the integration intervals to subintervals.</li>
					<li>Approximate the area under the curve as a rectangle in each subinterval.</li>
					<li>Sum the area of the approximated rectangles.</li>


					<p>Thus, integrating f(x) over integral [a,b] can be mathematically formulated as:</p>

					</p>

					<p>Where n is an arbitrary number that denotes intervals.</p>
					
					A nice visualization from <a href="https://www.storyofmathematics.com/riemann-sum/"> storyofmathematics.com/riemann-sum </a> can be seen as below, here note that
					we are approximating the area under f(x) from point a to point b using rectangles. An important point is to realize that
					width of these rectangles are always same, and equal to a small arbitrary value, <b>DeltaX</b>, such as 0.0001, 0.001 so on.

					<p>You are required to complete the <code>Polynomial</code> class with the following UML diagram:</p>

					<h2>Notes</h2>
					
					<li><b>Your code will be tested in the following manner. 
					
					<p>At first, a polynomial will be created.</p></b> 
					
					<p><code>Polynomial p1 = new Polynomial("x^3-x^2-3x+5")</code></p>
					
					<p>Given polynomial will be in this form: "ax^4+bx^3+cx^2+dx+e". It will be 4th degree equation at most.
					The equation may or may not have all coefficients, for example it may not have a term with x^2, x^3 or so on (We can give a polynomial
					such as "ax+b"). 
					All terms may not be
					in this order, for example we can give the same polynomial as "bx^3+ax^4+dx+e+cx^2". </p>
					
					<p>We will assume the given polynomial is in valid form. Note that this form ("ax^4+bx^3+cx^2+dx+e") does not have spaces
					between characters, it has ^ to show degree and it does not have * character. It can have + or - between coefficients.</p>
					
					<p><b>Then we may change deltaX:</b></p>
					
					<p><code>p1.setDeltaX(0.0002)</code></p>
					
					<p><b>At last, we will compute the integral:</b></p>
					
					<p><code>p1.computeIntegral(0,10)</code></p>
					
					</li>
					
					<li> Note that computeIntegral method returns an integer, you will compute Riemann sum as a double value however you need
					to return it as an int using type casting. As an example, you can have <code>double integration</code> in the method, holding
					the value of Riemann sum, you should return <code>(int)integration</code>. We need to do this to get consistent results on test cases.</li>
					
				</div>
				
				<h2>Grading</h2>
				
				<li>Your code will be tested in different scenarios to compute the integral. You need to consider edge cases to be
				able to get full points. You will get points from every testing scenario. Testing will be done in the manner that was explained in 
				the previous section. Therefore if your setDeltaX method does not work, your code may fail from some of the test cases. Make sure that
				all of your methods work.</li>
				
				<li>You are expected to use valueAt method in computeIntegral method.</li>
				
				<li>You are expected to fill the coefficients in coefficients ArrayList of Polynomial class and use it in your solution.</li>
